  The sound of the alarm fills the room and results in grumbles and sighs. The curtains a drawn against a still darkened sky. I roll over, sleepily, and turn off the alarm. I open my eyes, a full hour earlier than on work days, and slowly roll out of bed. Saturday mornings mea early wake up calls and a grueling group run. Every Saturday morning, those of us in the same training group, meet for our weekly long run. Resign ourselves to our fate and beat the heat to obtain our best possible pace before the rest of the world wakes.

  Saturday mornings mean trying to noiselessly dress in the dark. Means banana with peanut butter eaten slowly at the kitchen counter. Checking the weather on my phone while filling my water bottle and searching for my house keys. The lacing of shoes, fastening my running watch, and untangling the cords of my headphones. Walking, in the low morning light, to the start point. Exchanging greetings with fellow runners. New friendships and shared groans about the past weeks training schedule. Group stretches while the sun slowly makes its appearance. We all hold a small scrap of paper in one hand, with today's course, complete with a hydration stop. GPS locations found, watches on, and off we go.

   Off we go. Heavy humid air and the combined sound of 25 pairs of feet pounding the sidewalk. The sound of passion, commitment, and the unified drive for conquering 6 long miles. Stealing glances at my running watch to check for pace and distance. The thrill of passing a fellow runner who had outpaced you just weeks prior. Your mind screaming that this hill is too steep or the distance too far. Reminding yourself that your mind is just another obstacle to overcome. Every muscle crying in pain and lungs burning with every breath. Words of encouragement from peers and the burst of energy at the homestretch. High fives, deep breaths, and stretches.

    Starting the weekend with a long rewarding run while most people are still tucked into their beds. The realization and satisfaction of crushing a goal that, at first, felt so daunting. That while situations, circumstances, and even people may be slowing crushing you....running is actively fighting to keep you free.
