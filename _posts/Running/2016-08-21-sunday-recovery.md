 What does a recovery day look like for me during a half-marathon training program? Right now, it looks like a warm cozy bed with a feline friend that hoards the pillow space. It looks like waffles smothered in maple syrup and laughter in the kitchen while the morning sun streams in through the front windows. Leisurely drinking hot coffee on the couch while failing miserably at crossword puzzles. Forgotten phones and inside jokes.

  What does does a recovery run look like for me? A few short, effortless miles, and John Mellencamp playing loudly through the buds of my earphones. Enjoying the freedom that running offers and the pure love of an outdoor workout in my hometown. Passing homes and streets that have been etched into my memory since childhood.

   A recovery run on a sunny Sunday morning means foam rollers and stretch bands. Eyes watering while rolling out tight muscles and knots. The peace that sinks in, knowing that the afternoon holds, nothing that can be confused with productivity. Of sitting on a balcony in a summer breeze with a new book. Of cups of coffee with too much creamer, to sip on. The profound and comforting realization that the determination and focus that carries me through brutal runs and overwhelming workouts will also carry me through whatever life throws at me. It looks like a new perspective, a quiet moment, and a grateful mindset.
