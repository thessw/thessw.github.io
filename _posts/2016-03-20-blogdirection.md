 The idea for this blog has formed slowly over my short career and only began to
 solidify when I moved to memory care. Over the past couple years Iâ€™ve stumbled
 upon articles, books, and forums that provide a place of support and community
 for various career paths. However, I noticed one field that lacked such a
 resource; that of social work. Even within the actual workplace there was an
 obvious lack of support. Especially in long term care, social workers are a
 small department. In several jobs I have made up half of a two person
 department. This is in stark contrast to nursing departments, teachers, etc. As
 I delved further into my career I sought out resources to provide guidance,
 education, and motivation. I was disappointed at the lack of resources
 available and so the thought began to form that perhaps I should attempt to
 contribute. I tossed the idea around with loved ones and with co-workers; the
 idea continued to form and gain strength. Thus the concept of The Sassy Social
 Worker was formed.

  Over the years I have struggled and fought my way through the maze of social
  work. At times I have felt alone and without guidance. The close friendships
  formed in college quickly dissipated at we spread across the country tackling
  different areas of the field. I gleaned what information and support I could
  from supervisors but found that they were often difficult to relate to or have
  become too far removed from the field to be of any real use. What I desired
  was a peer that could commiserate over shared struggles, experiences, and
  failures. My hope is that this blog can become a place of reference. To cover
  topics and situations that all social workers face. Perhaps others can learn
  from my experiences, successes, and failures as I continue my journey in this
  crazy ever changing field. I would love, in the future, to invite fellow
  social workers to weigh in and diversify the content.

   Join me as I continue my journey down the ever changing path of my career.
   Follow me as a stumble, likely fall, and hopefully succeed in reaching my
   humble goals. I hope that this space will become a place for fellow social
   workers to commiserate, gain knowledge, and receive support. A resource for
   inspiration, motivation, and likely some comedy relief.
