 I’ve been working in long-term care for a number of years; first in the Social
 Services department for a well-known mid-western company and then later as the
 director of a 30 bed memory care unit. At the time, moving from case management
 to long term care seemed like a natural progression. A salary increase and the
 likely possibility (and eventuality) of moving up within the company was a
 great motivator to make the move. Unfortunately, somewhere between the
 promotions, wage increases, and the soul crushing ways of a major corporation,
 I lost sight of why I chose social work as a career. I became wrapped up in
 coworker politics, census numbers, and job duties. My focus shifted from one of
 goodwill to one of striving to meet goals, deadlines, and tasks. Where I once
 found satisfaction and fulfillment in helping others obtain goals, I was sucked
 into the idea of working for a business instead of for the residents. In early
 2015, I realized I had lost my way and began the challenging task of searching
 for a position that would bring me back to my roots. I knew immediately that I
 would have to leave long term care to find the inspiration and purpose that had
 drawn me to the field of social work.

 In the beginning, honestly, I wasn’t all that happy. I began as a Social
 Service Assistant and had a hard time relishing the idea of being someone’s
 assistant. I later took advantage of a Social Service Director position open at
 a nearby sister campus. For a while, I was very content in this position but
 slowly began to feel as though I wanted to be in a position that allowed me to
 create real change. A coworker brought to my attention that there was a
 Director of Memory Care position open within the company. I felt this position
 was a chance to grow as a social worker, but also gain experience is
 management. After going through three rather intense interviews, I was offered
 the position. After much consideration, I accepted the job. I was thrilled by
 the idea of being in a position to make real changes, have control of the admit
 process, and putting systems in place that would improve the lives of the
 residents under my care. I relished the idea of developing close relationships
 with the residents’ families and helping to guide them through their loved ones
 journey.

  Unfortunately, I was a little more naïve than I ever realized. I came into the
  position with the false assumption that I would have even a shred of control
  over the building. Within months of taking the position, I had faced many
  challenges, adversity and even failures. What they don’t tell you about
  working for a major corporation, in my experience, is that you are really
  nothing other than a figurehead. You are often a scapegoat that the company
  uses at their will. I was forced to implement policies I didn’t believe in,
  perform duties I was morally opposed to, and relay information to families
  that the company knew they would react strongly to. I was constantly the
  bearer of bad news to both the staff and the families of our residents. This
  didn’t exactly make me popular and really did a number on my morale.
  Furthermore, I was constantly at odds with the other members of the management
  team. When you are put in a position to be an advocate for 30 residents that
  are unable to speak for themselves, you must take this responsibility
  seriously. Which I did. This didn’t make me popular.

   It became increasingly difficult to go to work every day and have families
   come to me with a constant stream of complaints, concerns, and comments which
   I could do next to nothing about. Hearing my coworkers refer to me as a
   “bully, a mean girl, and abrasive” created a distance between us. Their
   perception of my actions affected the way they treated me. Families were
   constantly telling me that I was “too young” and “too inexperienced” for the
   position. (I would like to note that I, with my devoted memory care
   coworkers, worked hard to make the building successful. Improvements were
   made, goals were met, and we often exceeded expectations….despite my age and
   appearance).My morale began to suffer. My core staff, a handful of families,
   and of course my beloved residents had once outweighed the negativity I was
   exposed to. Over time, I could feel myself becoming jaded. I came to realize
   that even my own supervisor was not someone that I could really turn to or
   trust. At the same time the pressure to keep the beds full, families happy
   and to meet the increasing expectations of the position grew. Word to the
   wise; don’t ever take a salaried position. It’s a damn scam. Work a million
   hours and receive compensation for only 40? No, thank you. I knew it was time
   to leave. When my residents’ needs became overshadowed by the politics and
   company expectations I knew that I was no longer benefiting the building. I
   needed to take back control over my career and happiness.  

    That’s exactly what I did. I began looking feverishly for a new job that
    would put me back on the path I needed.  A path of opportunity, optimism,
    and one that didn’t involve working nights, weekends, and holidays. AKA no
    slave labor. Ever looked for a job while working full time?  You have to be
    pretty damn sneaky.  I’m happy to say that after months of searching,
    submitting appplications, and suffering through interviews, I finally
    accepted a position that I feel excited about. I feel certain that leaving
    long term care is the right decision. Leaving long term care was a major
    change, but one I feel certain about. Being wrapped up in a large
    corporation that is more focused on revenue than residents is not the place
    for me. Only took me a few years to find out; live and learn.
