  Have you ever reached a point where you are forced to stop and wonder how you
  got where you are? Right now, as I sit and evaluate my career I have to
  wonder; how did I get here? Almost exactly a year ago today I started my job
  as the director of a 30 bed memory care unit. After years of striving to
  better my career and standing in the social work world I really felt that I
  had made it. Long term care is a hard game to play but it felt as though I had
  won a battle. This field boasts one of the highest burn out rates; a fact I
  was all too aware of. In the pit of my stomach was a nagging feeling; could I
  really be successful here? Jumping from social work to a more administration
  role was quite the leap. My eagerness to show what I was capable of and naïve
  knowledge of what the position entailed provided a false sense of confidence
  that would fade in time.  A year later, the eagerness gone, I am in a
  challenging position, I’m sure we have all been here. Pondering. Questioning.
  Should I stay, or should I go?

  Memory care is a hard battle to fight and few health care workers can
  empathize with my struggles. A memory care unit is not for the weak at heart.
  I first believed that my main struggle would lie with coping with the
  continuous decline of my beloved residents, accepting their ever changing
  behaviors (i.e. that residents will defecate anywhere and everywhere), and
  keeping up with the copious amounts of paperwork an administrative position
  requires. Instead I was surprised to find that one of my major struggles was
  with the health care system itself, more specifically, the guidelines set up
  by the health care company I was employed by. It appears that while memory
  care is in ever increasing demand those that are on the outside seldom know
  how to manage the process. There is quite a difference between a memory unit
  and a psych ward; a fact I have never been able to effectively explain to my
  superiors (who are all about the money, money money). The amount of time I
  have spent fighting, arguing, and advocating for my memory unit is absolutely
  staggering. To the point that my passion and drive is often quite mistaken for
  abrasive and aggressive (a point of pride I might add). Those outside of
  memory care can never understand the careful balance that must be made to keep
  the peace within the unit. An inappropriate admit can lead to behaviors
  (throwing everything within reach, exit seeking, and spitting), upheaval
  (screaming, pissing on floors, etc), and at times violence (i.e. beating the
  shit out of each other, staff and visitors).

  Another daunting realization was that of dealing with the residents’ families.
  I had a vision of working closely with the families to ensure their loved ones
  received the high quality of care they deserved, of brainstorming solutions to
  behaviors, and being an integral part of their support team as the dementia
  slowly stole their loved one. Unfortunately that was a rather adorable vision
  compared to the reality of the situation. Families are rarely accepting of
  their loved ones diagnosis and live within a sweet bubble of delusion and
  denial. Often arguing that they see improvement and their loved one is almost
  certainly “cured” and should be able to return home soon. Families struggle to
  see behaviors, increased confusion, and the impending decline. They certainly
  don’t respond well to those trying to help them accept the truth of the
  situation and prepare them for the inevitable. I find that I often create a
  barrier between myself and families due to their denial of the situation.
  Seriously, someone has to let them know that yes….this will get worse and they
  will eventually die. Apparently the circle of life is not a well-known
  concept. The healthy, supportive, and evolving relationship I had hoped to
  have with the families is reduced to a strained and dysfunctional one. They
  cringe when they see my name on their caller id, avoid me in the halls, and
  only seek me out if they have a complaint or need someone to vent to (i.e
  scream at, berate, and attempt to make cry). This negative relationship weighs
  on me daily and crushes any morale I had been clinging to.

  Lastly, I find that the expectations of my position are not only overwhelming
  but almost certainly unattainable. It is not surprise that the average length
  of time a director of memory remains is approximately 18 months. Shocker. It
  is my responsibility to ensure the building runs smoothly in almost every
  aspect. I am in charge of the activities, events, and fundraising. My position
  manages all social services documentation, behaviors, and care planning. On
  top of disciplining staff, staff meeting, and family centered events. It is
  the expectation that the building will pass all peer led reviews with flying
  colors, state surveys without tags, and that the customers will be forever
  satisfied with every detail of their loved ones care. The hours one must put
  in to achieve this is staggering. A salaried position is every major
  corporations dream. Same amount of pay regardless of the hours that are put
  in. The frustration and exhaustion soon sets in. My endurance wanes and my
  spirits plummet. I ask myself; why am I still here? Any guesses?

  I know the answer, at least I think I do. It comes in two parts. First, the
  job market sucks. Hard. Finding a decent social work or administrative job is
  challenging at best. Second, more importantly, my love and devotion to the
  residents remains untouched. The memory care resident population is as unique
  and challenging as they come. I love my residents. Every single one of them.
  Although they are all effected by the same class of disease they are also all
  individuals with their own strengths, weaknesses, and blessings. The feeling
  it gives me to spend time with them is indescribable.  A rush of joy when I am
  able to connect with them, even just for a moment, is beyond rewarding.
  Creating tasks, outings, and conversations that allow them to connect to who
  they are is priceless. The look they give when they have achieved something
  they didn’t know they were capable of.

  Is this enough? Enough to keep me in my current job? Can I continue to
  compromise my self-worth, self-esteem, and satisfaction for the sake of the
  residents? If I continue to be so frustrated and lost am I really serving the
  residents to the best of my ability? Honestly? No. It have taken me a long
  time to come to grips with this reality. Ultimately, this isn’t about me. It’s
  about them. It always has been. I know myself enough to know that I need to
  move on. God bless the next poor, energetic, and passionate soul to step into
  this role. So the job search begins. Maybe I will be able to find another path
  to continue my love for social work, or if all else fails, fulfill my dream of
  being a stay at home girlfriend.
