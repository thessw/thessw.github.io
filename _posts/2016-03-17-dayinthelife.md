 There is no typical day for a memory care worker; every day is as unpredictable as the weather. I always begin each day with the naïve hope that my to-do list will magically disappear and that my productivity will be enviable. I firmly believe that the one sure fire way to maintain sanity in a memory care unit is to learn to go with the flow and find humor in the ever changing daily experiences. To find enjoyment out of the small moments you are able to connect with a resident or join in on the activities. Relishing the time you are able to escape the chaos long enough to use the restroom or maybe….perhaps….eat food that wasn’t cooked on campus. Still waiting for the day that I can take advantage of the ever elusive lunch break I hear so much about. Below is a play-by-play on the “typical” day in my life as a memory care director.

  8:00-9:30am. More like 8:05 depending on how long the line at Starbucks was this morning. Rush to unlock my office door and hope that no angry families have slipped hate notes under my door. Happens more often than I care to admit. Log on to my computer to check my email and update my to do list. To do list is a lose term I use to describe tasks I hope to complete at some point in my life.  Next I speed walk to the dining room to get ready to pass out coffee and juice to the residents. They are already waiting for me expectantly. (Aka shouting that I am late and for the love of god would I turn the heat up in this joint? 73 degrees is absolutely unbearable). Residents debate the pros/cons of decaffeinated coffee. There are no pros. Only cons. When the food cart is pushed out of the kitchen the nurses and I rush to pass out breakfast before there’s a full out riot.

  9:30-10:30am Staff meeting. Enough said.

  10:30-12:00pm Try to catch up on Social Service Progress Notes, MDS Assessments, and start planning the following months activity calendar. Return phone calls, avoid phone calls, and duck under my desk when overzealous family members walk in.

  12:00-1:00pm Lunch. See breakfast.

  1:00-2:00pm Meeting with unit manager, Director of Health Services, and Executive Director. I.e. passive aggressive comments, arguments over staffing, and behaviors.

  2:00-2:45pm Family member catches me off guard on my way to the bathroom to rant about the negligence of the laundry staff. Missing sock and mattress cover in the same week? What’s to keep her from calling her the State Board of Health to submit an official complaint? Profuse apologizing on my part and ass kissing. Four years of college to learn how to talk someone off the ledge over a missing sock. What a skill.

  2:45-3:00pm Rant with unit manager over crazy families. Review most recent dose reductions related to mood and behaviors. Exciting stuff. Complain about coworkers and the new nurse with multiple med errors (would she please stop presetting meds?).

  3:00-4:00pm Sundowning has hit full strength. One lovely little lady rolls into my office to yell profanities and gracefully defecate in my trash can. A dapper older gentleman rushes through the door in a frenzy to drop off a bag of soiled diaper briefs and to steal a stack of newspapers. I hear a chair alarm sounding and jump out of my chair to find our favorite klepto walking away with a box of diapers. Oh the joys. I wander into the dining room to observe half a dozen residents calmly folding dinner napkins while their peer
  screams bloody murder a few feet away for no apparent reason. I rush to comfort her as a nurse runs past me to the front door where several residents are attempting to follow a visitor out.  While crouching down with my shrieking friend our famously handsy resident finds it the ideal time to cop a feel of my back side.

 4:00-4:30pm Sit at the nurses station desk to document on behaviors/med reductions while handing out suckers to rowdy residents. Candy is often the cure. Always on the lookout for families wanting to berate the facility, staff, and myself about unavoidable issues. Upset their loved ones’ dementia is progressing, their demented loved one went to bed at 9:05 last night instead of 9:00pm, or an aide forgot their beloved father prefers to drop a deuce immediately following lunch and not a moment later. Can’t. Care. I put on a good face and apologize.

 4:30-5:00pm Scramble to set tables (why must we use real linens? Why??) and attempt to seat all of the residents at the dining room tables. Try to remember which residents can’t sit with each other and try to block out the profanities of the little old lady screeching in the corner about the room temp. Ever try to round up 30 drunk toddlers? Pretty sure this is the equivalent of doing so. Explain to wandering residents that we are getting ready for supper, intervene when residents get rowdy, and lie for the umpteenth time today that Ingrid’s car is in the  shop being repaired but will be back tomorrow.   

 5:00-5:30pm Assist staff with serving drinks and dinner. Plan my escape for the day. Dodge family members, visitors, and all residents that have a tendency to bite.

 5:30-6:00pm Rush to my office and throw all my things in my work bag. Realize I never ate the lunch that I so carefully packed the night before. Peak around the corner to ensure there are no residents waiting for the front door to open. Speed walk toward the service hall exit…..and am snagged by a family member leaving the public bathroom. Did I know that our competitor across town has better staffing/rates/whatever? (Great. Take them there.) Listen to 20 minutes of threats of moving their loved one across town. (Don’t care. Stop talking and do it already). Profusely apologize for all issues. Ever. Kiss some more ass and practically sprint to the door. Once I’m outside I make sure to keep my head down and refuse to make eye contact with anyone. Ignore people calling for me (Justine who? Don’t know anyone by that name…) and breathe a sign of relief as I jump into my car and peel out of my parking spot.

 6:01pm remind myself that I love my job and this is my chosen profession. Also ponder that this may be how many alcohol addictions begin.
